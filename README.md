# LBM-multicomponent
My code developed during my master project thesis.


The repository contains the matlab and python version of single component coutte flow in two dimension. 
And the code for multi-component flow in uniform channels;
 model using Shan and chen for uniform geometry channel. 

#Step to run
- Calculate the LBM parameter from the physical properties (ref https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.langmuir.6b02788)
- Compile and run imbibitionUniformChannel.c
